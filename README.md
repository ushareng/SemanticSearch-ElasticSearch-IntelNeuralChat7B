Combining Semantic Search with Elastic Search to improve search efficiency for Accessibility &amp; Inclusion using Intel’s Quantization and Neural-Chat-7b

Traditional search engines rely on keyword matching, often missing the user’s intent. This example explores how semantic search, combined with Elasticsearch, enhances search accuracy. Semantic search understands the meaning behind words, leading to more relevant results. This approach not only improves overall search efficiency but also promotes accessibility and inclusion. For users with disabilities, like visual impairments, semantic search can interpret the intent behind a voice search query and deliver optimized results for assistive technologies. In essence, this approach makes information retrieval more intuitive and effective for everyone.
